# Squares Sum 
 
This project includes an algorithm to find combinations of perfect squares that sum to a given number. 
 
## Installation 
Use the following command to install dependencies: 
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 
 
## Usage 
To run the code and find combinations, use the `find_squares_sum` function in the `src/squares_sum.py` file. 
 
```python 
from src.squares_sum import find_squares_sum 
n = 20 
max_square = 20 
combinations = find_squares_sum(n, max_square) 
print(combinations) 
```
